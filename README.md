- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeff Jaspar

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding in general, data analysis and blockchain technology. 
Big fan of Zilliqa and very excited about their current projects.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m vey old school as I started coding in the late 1980's and 90's. 
My 1st home computer was a Commodore Vic20 and I was immediately hooked. 
I taught myself coding in BASIC and Assembler and learned to read/write Pascal and C/C++ during my first job as a programmer. I was involved in small scale
custom automation projects operating as senior software developer.

However, in the 25 years that passed I moved on to other professional challenges and coding is now more of a hobby. But blood is thicker than water, 
so I want to close the circle and move back to being part of technological developments. I'm currently learning Python and I also want to learn more 
about coding dApps on the Zilliqa blockchain.
